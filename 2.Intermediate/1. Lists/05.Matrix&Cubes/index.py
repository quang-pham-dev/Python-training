# 2D List
# A list is a versatile data structure that can store multiple elements. Lists can be one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), or even higher-dimensional.
# 1D List
# A one-dimensional list is a simple list that contains elements in a linear sequence.
# 2D List
# A two-dimensional list is essentially a list of lists. Each element in the outer list is itself a list.
# 3D List
# A three-dimensional list is a list of lists of lists. It can be thought of as a cube of elements, where each element is a list.

# 1D
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(my_list)

# 2D
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

print(matrix)

# 3D
cube = [
    [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]],
    [[10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18]],
    [[19, 20, 21], [22, 23, 24], [25, 26, 27]],
]

print(cube)
