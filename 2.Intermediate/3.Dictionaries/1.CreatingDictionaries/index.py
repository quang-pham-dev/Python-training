# Dictionaries?
# A dictionary is a built-in data type that represents a collection of key-value pairs.
# It is a highly flexible and efficient data structure used for mapping keys to values.
# Key features of dictionaries
# ðŸ‘‰ Each element in a dictionary consists of a key and its corresponding value. The key is a unique identifier for the value.
# ðŸ‘‰ Unlike lists, dictionaries are unordered collections, which means the order of elements is not guaranteed.
# ðŸ‘‰ Dictionaries can be modified after creation. You can add, remove, or update key-value pairs.
# ðŸ‘‰ Dictionaries can grow or shrink in size as needed.
# ðŸ‘‰ Each key in a dictionary must be unique. If you try to add a key that already exists, the new value will overwrite the existing one.

# Using the dict() Constructor

# Dictionary with Different Data Types
mixed_dict = {"name": "Charlie", "age": 30, "grades": [85, 90, 78], "is_student": True}

# Nested Dictionary
nested_dict = {
    "person": {"name": "David", "age": 22},
    "location": {"city": "Paris", "country": "France"},
}
print(nested_dict)

# Using a List of Tuples
tuple_list = [("name", "Eva"), ("age", 28), ("city", "Berlin")]
from_tuples_dict = dict(tuple_list)
