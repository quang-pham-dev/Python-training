# Module?
# A module is a file containing Python code. This code can define functions, classes, and variables.
# Modules help organize related code into files that can be easily reused and imported into other Python scripts.
# Python's standard library is a collection of modules that provide ready-to-use functionality for tasks like file I/O,
# networking, and more.
